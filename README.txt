**About Promolayer**

Promolayer was created in Japan. Firstly out of frustration with other global platforms like Poptin, Optinmonster, Hubspot, Privy etc that both don't fully support Japanese or have Japanese templates and overcharge for the service. Since then Promolayer has grown and grown and now fully supports English and is bringing world-class Japanese design sense and customer service to the global market.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is there a plugin? Isn't this just a gateway to a SaaS? =

Our plugin lets us tighten our integrations with Wordpress. Aside from one-click installation and auto domain re-configuring when you migrate between environments our plugin also allows for automatic coupon generation and cart integrations with WooCommerce which wouldn't be possible without a plugin.

If you don't want to use the plugin you can sign up for a generic account at promolayer.io and just copy paste a single line of code in. Please be aware in doing so you will not have access to all auto configurations and coupon / cart integrations.

= How are popup views counted? =

Every time the Promolayer plugin generates content on a page a single view is counted. We feel this is a very fair way of counting as if you have a welcome popup set to only show once you will only be charged for a single view per user no matter how many more pages the user sees. If you are a heavy user with popups on every page then each page will be counted.

= How well does Promolayer convert? =

Expect conversion rates to be fantastic. Our platform has proven to convert at consistently higher rates than our competitors due to our highly-usable forms and CVR focused features such as real time email domain correction.

The final conversion rate will depend on your usage of the platform, the deals you offer your customers and the design and triggering you choose. For our paying customers we've got a team of CRO experts on hand to help you maximize your conversion rate.

= Do I need a developer to get started? =

No, the Promolayer plugin auto-integrates everything. Just log in and you are ready to go.

= Can I customize the popups? =

Sure you can! Promolayer has a content builder when you can customize most parts of the popups, slide-ins, banners, coupon wheels and fullscreen displays.

= Will Promolayer make any changes to my site? =

Promolayer adds a single script to your site to enable the popup functionality. If you choose to disable it the script will be gone with no lasting changes whatsoever. Promolayer makes no changes to your sites structure, database etc.
